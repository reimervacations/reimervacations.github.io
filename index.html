	<h1>Reimer Vacations</h1>
	<p>Hi Alvina!  The first time I did all this, I was learning as I went, so there were always things to do.  Now I've realized that almost all the time was spent waiting for things to be processed.</p>
	<p>I've worked 6 actual hours so far, but with all the waiting it's been 6 days of "please wait for your action to process..."</p>
	<p>You mentioned earlier that I was teaching you things, so take this as reassurance that I'm learning plenty as well :)</p>
	<p>Now comes the real work, where I'll need you to decide exactly what should be on here.  Finding sites that look how you want, or pictures, or even sketches of the kind of layout you'd like.  I'll maybe find a few good templates and put them up to show you.</p>
